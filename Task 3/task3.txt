Question:
In Task 1, you created an "Abstract Base Class" for the Knowledge Retriever.
Explain why this is useful in a production environment. If we decided to switch from Oracle
23ai (which you used in your project) to a simple local JSON file for testing, how does your
abstraction help us?

Answer:
Abstract base class is used to set a standard structure that all of its subclass are required to implement 
so that it is consistant across all classes. It keeps all the logic the business logic, database, the llm 
all loosely coupled, therefor they donot entangle with other classes and maitaines consitancy amonge all related classes

It helps other developers to understand the functions, easy to loacte, modify and reuse code in cases where 
same function is needed to be used in several places 

if we need to switch to a json file we can create a new class for a local json file that inherits the Abstract class, and just 
add its implementation, other classes dont need to be disturbed. It can seamlessly work for without needing to modify other codes
